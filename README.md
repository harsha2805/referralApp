# Gamer Waitlist

Gamer Waitlist is an application that helps potential customers sign up for a waiting list for a new product.
- The first user starts at position 1, the next at position 100, the next at 101, and so on...
- If a new user signs up using his referral code, the parent user will move up one position.
- If a user reaches position 1, he will be emailed a coupon code.
- The administrator has the ability to view and delete users.
